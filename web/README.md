# Frontend for the Casino of Life

## This is a nextjs app that is still in development.

## It is built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

### This needs a lot work and I'm not sure what all to include in this.  Besides everything..  Reown app kit, A custom PyPI package that is in the backend that holds the character agents for interactions.  This uses php for various scripts to interact with the backend and I have prisma and mysql running as well.  I still have to complete the proper registry for all of the ai agents trained to play video games with the casino-of-life pypi package.  I'm not sure if most this even needs to go into this README or just keep exclusive to the frontend.  I need to make sure that when deploy this specific version I create a new branch for it in my cimai decentralize games orginization so I can submit it to Reown for the bounty.  We are going to add more games in the near future.  I think I need to add more to the .gitignore. only .env is in there 

### Before fixing all of this make sure you do understand my project so this is a very well to do frontend for others and epsicially reown to look at. 

I don't know if I should  include my .php scripts becasue I don't want anything compromised but then the users who would try and use this wouldn't know how the route.ts files work my droplet.  so need to figure out how to do that.
